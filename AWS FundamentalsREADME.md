# AWS Fundamentals
[Amazon Web Services], or AWS, is an Amazon company that offers on-demand cloud computing and APIs to people, organizations, and governments. The service’s popularity stems from its precise per-hour charging cost, simple sign-up process, remarkable stability, and a platform as a trusted provider.

AWS now operates in 20 regions, or separate geographic areas, with five more on the way. Each part has two or more availability zones (AZ) or data centers.

A high-level analysis of AWS reveals a three-tiered architecture that begins with AWS Accounts, then moves on to Regions, and finally to Availability Zones. The Account level is in charge of billing, Identity, and Access Management (IAM), which is essentially a program that allows users to securely access AWS services, and Route53, a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
The following is a simple description of Regions: to upload data such as photographs, videos, and documents to Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service; an S3 bucket must first be established. Buckets and objects are resources in terms of creation, and Amazon S3 provides APIs to manage them. Amazon’s NoSQL database service, DynamoDB, provides key-value and document data formats at the regional level while serving as a database for Amazon. Another tool provided by Amazon at the Region level is the VPC or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, which allows users to create a virtual network on the AWS cloud without the need for VPNs, hardware, or an actual data center. Amazon’s Elastic Load Balancing is most notably software that automatically distributes incoming application traffic among several destinations.

Amazon Elastic Computation Cloud (EC2) delivers safe; resizable compute capacity in the cloud at the AZ level. Netflix, Twitch, Linked In, Facebook, BBC, and ESPN all utilize EC2 every month. Amazon Relational Database Service is a cloud-based relational database. Finally, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is raw block-level storage linked to Amazon EC2 instances, and RDS utilizes. EBS offers a variety of storage performance and pricing choices.
I hope you found this quick overview of Amazon Web Services Accounts, Regions, and Availability Zones helpful.
